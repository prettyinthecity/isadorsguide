<h4>All Purpose Flour Bread</h4>
<ul>
    <li>435g of water</li>
    <li>2.125 of yeast</li> 
    <li>500g of all purpose flour</li>
    <li>10g of salt</li>
</ul>
<h3>Equipment</h3>
<ul>
    <li>A bowl</li>
    <li>Plastic wrap</li> 
    <li>A spoon</li>
    <li>A oven</li>
    <li>Two dough scrapers</li>
    <li>Parchment paper</li>
    <li>A half sheet tray</li>
</ul>

<h3>Method</h3>
	<h4>Poolish</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Stir 150g of room temperature water, ⅛ teaspoon OR a small pinch of yeast, and 150g of all purpose flour with a spoon till it is semi-runny and sticky. If poolish is too dry, and ½ a tablespoon of water until it is semi-runny and sticky</li>
    <li>Put plastic wrap OR damp cloth over the bowl for however you would like your crust. Let sit for 48 hours for nice crust, 24 hours for “so-so” crust, and 4-16 hours for basic bread</li>
</ol>

    <h4>Making The Dough</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Stir 280g of water (98 degrees fahrenheit), 2g of yeast, and the poolish from before with a spoon</li>
    <li>Slowly stir in 400g of all purpose flour and 10g of salt with a spoon OR 350g of all purpose flour, 50g of whole wheat flour, and 10g of salt for a different flavor with a spoon</li>
    <li>Wet your hands and do 60-90 seconds of squeeze, rotate, and repeat</li>
    <li>Put plastic wrap over the bowl and let sit for 30 minutes</li>
    <li>Wet your hands again and 8-9 scoop, pull as much as you can, and then place the pulled portion of the dough on top of the portion already in the bowl</li>
    <li>6-7 scoop it from underneath, turn it 90 degrees and fold it on itself</li>
    <li>Put plastic wrap over the bowl and let sit for 30 minutes again</li>
    <li>Repeat steps 5, 6, and 7</li>
    <li>Put plastic wrap over the bowl and let sit for 1 hour</li>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 525 degrees fahrenheit</li>
</ol>
    <h4>Shaping and Cooking the Dough</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Flip the dough onto a lightly floured workspace, lightly flour the dough, and grab a half sheet tray and line it with parchment</li>
    <li>Cut the dough in half with a dough scraper</li>
    <li>Tuck the ends of the dough masses, fluff it, take each corner and put it in the middle and put the seam face side down.</li>
    <li>Put the dough on the half sheet tray</li>
    <li>Spray the loaves with a little water</li>
    <li>Bake for 20-25 minutes or when the dough gets brown and crispy</li>
</ol>

<p>
    <strong>Notes:</strong> Usually the parchment will burn and your home will start smoking up. Don't be alarmed, this is how things are supposed to be. Just crack a window. I also suggest if your bread loaf isn’t looking brown enough, you should do five minute increments. To tailor your recipe to your altitude, experiment and record your new numbers in a notebook.
